Brought us here... you don't mean transported us to this mansion, do you? #speaker : Alice
Don't be coy with me! I know it's you that did it. You are so... strange! Such a strange little girl. My card soldiers told me you were called Mad Alice! and how mad you seem. #speaker : Queen of Hearts
* I am not mad! How rude! #speaker : Alice
   The child disagrees with a proclamation! How curious. How quaint. Well then, not so mad Alice-  #speaker : Queen of Hearts

    Go home! Why would you leave here when you have brought us all? Is there not a home for you in this place? Or perhaps it is your home that we have taken you from.  #speaker : Queen of Hearts
    No, ma'am- Your majesty? I don't know what you mean but I really ought to be leaving this place! My home is somewhere above, I think - I fell here, but here is so strange, its hard to say!  #speaker : Alice

Please, your majesty, I never said-  #speaker : Alice
Liar, liar, liar, LIAR! How cruel a child! How awful! To try to trick a queen. Me! The Queen of Hearts! I do not take kindly to insults.  #speaker : Queen of Hearts

I shall take no more demands from a liar! No, no. In fact, I will give you the most appropriate punishment instead.  #speaker : Queen of Hearts
Please-  #speaker : ALice
GUARDS! OFF WITH HER HEAD!  #speaker : Queen of Hearts
